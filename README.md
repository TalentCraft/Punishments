# Punishments

This is the official database of all TalentCraft punishments, any punishment should be recorded here.  If the staff member who issued the punishment against you does not file a pull request within 48 hours of the event will be an automatic unpunishment.  Only in the event of grave punishment will this be overlooked.  

A reminder to staff... file the punishments or the person can have it squashed immeditally.
