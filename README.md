# Punishments

This is the official database of all TalentCraft punishments, any punishment should be recorded here.  If the staff member who issued the punishment against you does not file a pull request within 48 hours of the event will be an automatic unpunishment.  Only in the event of grave punishment will this be overlooked.  

A reminder to staff... file the punishments or the person can have it squashed immeditally. 

If you wish to appeal a ban please open an issue... please state all of the facts truthfully and professionally.  Likewise if you wish to report someone open an issue with all facts and information you can provide.  It is there in which we will conduct investigations.
